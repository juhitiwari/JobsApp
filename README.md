JobsApp is a job finding application developed using React Native and Expo. The app uses Facebook authentication and the Github 
Jobs API to fetch jobs nearby the location chosen by the user on the map. Currently the API does not contain information about 
job openings in India, thus international location has been pinned in the map.
The application supports tinder-like swipe cards to display jobs, like them and save them for further reference. 
The application has been developed using Redux, Redux Persist and the Animations module.
